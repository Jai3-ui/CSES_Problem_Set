# CSES Problem Set 
This repository contains solutions for the CSES Problem Set written in C++.
# About CSES Problem Set 
CSES Problem Set is a collection of algorithmic programming problems. The problems are divided into different categories such as introductory problems, sorting and searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, etc. The problems are available in English and Finnish languages.
# About Solution 
All the solutions are written in C++. Each solution is stored in a separate file with the name of the problem. The solution files are named as per the problem code. For example, the solution for the problem "Missing Number" with problem code 1083 is stored in a file named 1083.cpp.
# Running Solutions 
To run the solutions, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can compile the solution files using any C++ compiler. For example, if you are using g++ compiler, you can compile the solution file using the following command:

g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -pedantic -o <output_file_name> <input_file_name>.cpp

Replace <output_file_name> with the name of the output file you want to generate and <input_file_name> with the name of the solution file. For example, if you want to generate an output file named 1083.out from the solution file 1083.cpp, you can use the following command:

g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -pedantic -o 1083.out 1083.cpp

Once you have generated the output file, you can run the program using the following command:

./<output_file_name>

Replace <output_file_name> with the name of the output file you have generated. For example, if you have generated an output file named 1083.out, you can run the program using the following command:

./1083.out
