Approach 

This code implements an algorithm to find the missing number from an array of size n-1, which contains all the integers from 1 to n except for one.

The approach is based on the idea of marking visited elements in the array. To do this, the program initializes a vector of size n with all elements set to zero. Then, it reads in n-1 integers from the input, and for each of them, it sets the corresponding element in the vector to 1.

Finally, the program loops through the vector and finds the first element that is still 0. The index of this element plus 1 is the missing number, which is printed to the console.

For example, if the input is:
            5
            1 2 4 5
The program will create a vector with the following values:
            0 0 1 0 1
Then, it will loop through the vector and find the first 0, which is at index 1. 
Adding 1 to this index gives us the missing number, which is 3.
