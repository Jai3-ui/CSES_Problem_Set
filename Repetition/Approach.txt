The program defines a function called solve() that takes no arguments and returns no values. Inside this function,
it first reads a string from standard input using the cin object.

Base Case 
it checks the length of the string using the size() method of the string object. If the length of the string is equal to 1, it prints 1 and returns.

it initializes three variables maxi, i, and j to 1, 0, and 1, respectively. 
maxi will store the length of the longest substring with non-repeating characters found so far, while i and j are pointers to the start and end of the current substring being considered.

The program then enters a loop that continues as long as j is less than the length of the string. Inside the loop, it checks if the character at i is the same as the character at j. If they are the same, it increments j and updates maxi to the maximum of its current value and the difference between j and i.

If the characters at i and j are different, the program updates maxi to the maximum of its current value and the difference between j and i, sets i to j, and increments j.

Once the loop finishes, the program prints the value of maxi, which represents the length of the longest substring with non-repeating characters in the input string.

Finally, the program defines a main() function that simply calls the solve() function and returns 0.
